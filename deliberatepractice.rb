# Choose a deliberate practice problem to work on.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.

number = 12
if number == 10
  puts 0
else
  puts -1
end

# JavaScript
var number = 12
if (number === 10) {
  console.log(0);
} else {
  console.log(-1);
} 
# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# I was able to solve the Ruby part from Memory. However, I recently started from the beginning and am working my way forward in the deliberate practice problems as I want to build fluency with JavaScript. Therefore, I had a couple of syntax errors initially with the JavaScript answer. I will continue to work on the basics with JavaScript.
